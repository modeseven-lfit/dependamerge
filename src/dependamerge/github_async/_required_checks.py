        Get required status checks for a branch by inspecting rulesets.

        Only rulesets whose ``conditions.ref_name`` patterns match *branch*
        are considered.  Classic branch protection is read as well and
        the two are unioned, because GitHub enforces both: they are
        cumulative rather than alternatives.
        Returns ``(checks, reliable)``, where each check is a dict with
        'context' and optionally 'integration_id', deduplicated by
        ``context``.

        ``reliable`` is False when any lookup failed, which is what makes
        the empty list interpretable.  A token that cannot read rulesets
        --- ``GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets`` returned 403 throughout the
        503-PR run in ``docs/BULK_RUN_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`` --- produces
        exactly the same empty list as a branch with no requirements, and
        a caller reasoning about *absence* must be able to tell them
        apart.

        Results are cached per ``owner/repo@branch`` for the session:
        required-check configuration is repo/branch-level state that does
        not change while dependamerge runs, and the block-reason analysis
        consults it repeatedly (several times per blocked PR).  The
        uncached path costs 3 + N requests (repo metadata, ruleset list,
        one detail GET per ruleset, and branch protection), so the cache
        saves a burst of API traffic on every repeat.  The cost is per
        ``owner/repo@branch`` rather than per pull request.

        That holds *per repository* under the striped scheduler owner-wide
        runs use, which keeps at most one pull request per repository in
        flight, so the first read populates the cache before the next
        asks.  The flat scheduler starts every pull request at once and
        the cache has no single-flight lock, so concurrent first reads of
        one repository can each issue these requests --- flat scheduling
        is used for single-PR and single-repository batches, where the
        duplication is bounded by that batch.

        Results assembled
        while any of those
        requests failed are *not* cached: the fetch treats errors as
        "no required checks", and pinning that error-derived verdict
        for the whole session could misclassify blocked PRs long after
        a transient outage has passed.
