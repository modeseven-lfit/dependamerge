        The recorded reason describes what was unsatisfied at the instant
        the merge was refused, which routinely includes required checks
        that had merely not finished.  Nothing re-read that between the
        rejection and the report, so a pull request that went green
        moments later was still printed as failed, under a cause that no
        longer held --- and an operator sent to investigate it found
        nothing wrong.

        Reads ``mergeable_state`` from the payload :meth:`_confirm_failure`
        has already fetched, so settling this costs no further request.

        ``unknown`` stays a failure.  GitHub computes mergeability in the
        background and reports ``unknown`` until it has, so the value is
        an absence of evidence rather than evidence of a block --- but it
        is equally not evidence that the PR would merge, and only that
        would justify withdrawing a reported failure.

        A closed pull request never qualifies, whatever its mergeable
        state says.  :meth:`_confirm_failure` reaches here for one that
        is closed with merged-ness unknown --- a trimmed payload carrying
        neither ``merged`` nor ``merged_at`` --- and such a payload can
        still report ``clean``.  Telling an operator to re-run and merge
        a closed PR would be advice they cannot act on.

        Only a failure GitHub itself produced by *refusing the merge* is
        eligible.  The run reports ``FAILED`` for its own troubles too
        --- an unhandled exception, a rebase that did not complete --- and
        those say nothing about mergeability.  Rewriting one because the
        PR happens to read ``clean`` would bury the actionable error in a
        note the summary never prints, and advise a re-run that would
        fail identically.

        The recorded reason is GitHub's own rejection message, preferred
        over state-based inference because it usually carries the
        actionable cause.  On a ruleset rejection it frequently does not:
        it lists the rules that were evaluated, including ones that had
        merely not finished, and it can omit the condition actually
        holding the merge.  python-workflows#84 was reported against
        three workflows that had all passed, while ``pre-commit.ci - pr``
        --- a status context, invisible to any check-runs-only view ---
        was the sole blocker.

        The head and base come from *refreshed* rather than from the
        snapshot taken before the merge was attempted.  A dependabot
        rebase moves the head, and this tool requests those rebases, so
        reading the snapshot's commit would report conditions belonging
        to a commit nobody is trying to merge.  The same reasoning keeps
        the head current during the wait (``_wait.py``).

        Only ``blocked`` is re-examined.  A conflicted, behind or draft
        PR is already described accurately by its state, so reading its
        checks would spend requests without adding anything.
