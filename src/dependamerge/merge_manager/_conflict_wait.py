The waiting phases of conflict recovery.

Clearing a conflict by rebase costs two bounded waits — one for the
rebase itself, then one for the checks that follow it — plus the
terminal steps that turn each outcome into a result.  They live apart
from the conflict handler so that it reads as the sequence it is.

        retries, or a 422 the loop stopped on, are indistinguishable at
        the call site from GitHub answering ``merged: false``.  Only the

        Defers to :meth:`_failure_summary_from_exception`, the same

        API failure by that classifier, and this helper runs on exactly
        that state, so a bare status allowlist would withdraw the one
        case the classifier singles out as not being a verdict.

        No stored exception means nothing was raised and the API itself
        answered, which is a verdict.

        A *stale* entry --- one from an attempt before the rebase --- can
        only be read when the attempt just made raised nothing, since
        any exception it did raise would have replaced it.  So the worst
        such an entry causes is a refusal left standing, which is the
