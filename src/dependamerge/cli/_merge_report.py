    Failures are rendered in a consistent shape so the final summary is

      1. the failed PR URL (prepended by the caller),

         `` / `` and carry no trailing colon, e.g.
         ``Repository rule violations found / Required workflows failed``,
      3. one bullet (``• ``) per individual failing condition.

    Repository-ruleset violations arrive from GitHub as one long string
    that crams the offending workflow / status-check names into a
    quoted, comma-separated clause.  We split that into the type line
    plus a bullet per name for both the ``Required workflows`` and
    ``Required status check(s)`` variants.  Reasons we do not recognise
    are returned unchanged as a single line.

    One rejection can name **both** kinds, and each is reported: a
    failing status context such as ``pre-commit.ci - pr`` used to be
    dropped whenever a workflow was named alongside it, leaving the
    summary listing conditions that pass and omitting the one that
    blocks.  Each kind also carries its own verb, because workflows that
    have not finished routinely accompany a context that has failed.
