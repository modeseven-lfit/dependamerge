The ``GitHubClient`` entry point.

This module holds the client's construction and the one operation that
needs no network access at all, :meth:`GitHubClient.parse_pr_url`.

The API-backed operations live in :mod:`.queries` (reads),
:mod:`.actions` (writes) and :mod:`.status` (mergeability
interpretation), and are mixed in here, so the client exposes exactly the
method surface it always did.  The logger name is unchanged so records
keep reporting as ``dependamerge.github_client``.
