"""Tests for the diagnosis a failed merge reports.

A 157-PR owner-wide run reported 17 failures.  Sampling four of them
against the API showed the stated cause was wrong in every case, and
that two of the four were fully mergeable by the time the run printed
them as failed (lfreleng-actions/dependamerge#482).

The cause is that a merge rejection is a *snapshot*.  GitHub states what
was unsatisfied at the instant the merge was attempted, which routinely
names required checks that had merely not finished, and nothing re-read
that before the summary was printed.  The four sampled pull requests are
used here as fixtures so the reported outcome is driven by the state
they were actually in:

===========================  ================  ====================
