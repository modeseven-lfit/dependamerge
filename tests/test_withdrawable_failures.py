"""Tests for which failures a later reading may withdraw.

``MergeResult.merge_refused`` marks a failure as GitHub declining the
merge *on the pull request's state*.  Only such a failure may be
withdrawn when the confirmation step finds the PR mergeable, because a
run-side failure — an exception, a rebase that did not complete, a
missing token scope — says nothing about mergeability and would be
buried rather than corrected.

The conflict paths reach a state verdict and did not opt in, so
``lfreleng-actions/hw-bom-javascript#317`` was reported as::

    rebase cleared the conflict but the PR could not be merged
    (auto-merge unavailable)

and merged untouched on the next run over the same organisation.  It was
re-runnable when the run called it failed.
